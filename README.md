# Github for Composers

### Explanation

[Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is an internet hosting service for open source software developement and version control using a piece of softward called git. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) was originally developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) because he needed better version control software for his developement of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel). Since its inception, git and github have been used for such projects as Musescore and Audacity. I have found that this version control software works very well for large scale compositional projects, and reasonably well with music production. With this website, I hope to create a resource for the people who work with me on projects that would benefit from version control so that I don't have to teach them in person every time!
